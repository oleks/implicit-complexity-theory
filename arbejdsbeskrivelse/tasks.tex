\section{Tasks}

The thesis consists of two parts: and introductory part, and a body of work.

The introductory part is expected to be completed within the first working
month, and covers the learning obejctives (\ref{survey})--(\ref{language})
above.

The rest of the thesis is concerned with implicitly categorising the chosen
complexity classes, and extending the language, enabling the programmer to
write effectful bounded sections, arriving perhaps, at a language useful in
practice. This covers the learning objectives
(\ref{categorise})--(\ref{extend}).
