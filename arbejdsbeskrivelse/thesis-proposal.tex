\section{Thesis Proposal}

We consider designing a family of languages for complexity-bounded computation.
We are concerned with the ``feasible'' complexity classes, i.e. P, and those
contained in P.

We seek to incorporate this family into a single programming language, where
the programmer can state, and be statically guaranteed, a computational
complexity bound on a program section, e.g. the entire program.

We first consider a programming language where all computation is bounded to P,
e.g. \cite{bellantoni-cook-1992,jones-1999}.  We then consider subsets of this
language, bounded to subsets of P. We extend the original language with new
constructs, if useful to our subsets, and syntactic sugar, if useful for
programming.

The thesis proposal is thereby twofold:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item implicitly categorise a range of complexity classes under P; and

\item devise a programming language, supporting bounded and effectful program
sections.

\end{enumerate}

The bounds are guaranteed trivially if we only allow for a no-op in a bounded
section. So by ``effectful'', we mean that stating a higher bound enables more
complex computation.
