\section{Thesis Proposal}

We consider designing a family of languages for complexity-bounded computation.
We are concerned with the ``feasible'' complexity classes, i.e. P, and those
contained in P.

We seek to incorporate this family into a single programming language, where
the programmer can state, and be statically guaranteed, a computational
complexity bound on a program section, e.g. the entire program.

We first consider a programming language where all computation is bounded to P,
e.g. \cite{bellantoni-cook-1992,jones-1999}. We extend this language with
syntactic sugar, if useful to programming, and constructs for annotating
program sections with complexity bounds. Within a bounded section, we restrict
the programmer to a subset of the language, reducible to an implicit
categorisation of the stated complexity class.

The thesis proposal is thereby twofold:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item implicitly categorise a range of complexity classes under P; and

\item devise a programming language, supporting bounded and effectful program
sections.

\end{enumerate}

The bounds are guaranteed trivially if we only allow for a no-op in a bounded
section. So by ``effectful'', we mean that stating a higher bound enables more
complex computation.
