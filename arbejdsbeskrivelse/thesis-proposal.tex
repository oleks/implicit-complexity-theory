\section{Thesis Proposal}

We consider building a programming language where the programmer can state a
bound on the computational complexity of a program section, and have those
bounds statically guaranteed.

We proceed by limiting the programmer to a subset of the language within a
bounded section, where the subset is reducible to an implicit categorisation of
the stated bound. 

The thesis proposal is thereby twofold:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item implicitly categorise a range of interesting complexity classes; and

\item devise a programming language, supporting effectful program sections,
bounded to the above classes.

\end{enumerate}

The bounds are guaranteed trivially if we only allow for a no-op in a bounded
section. So by ``effectful'', we mean that stating a higher bound should enable
more complex computation.
