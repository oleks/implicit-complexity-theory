\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Find and survey previous work in an area of research in Computer Science.

\item Explain and contrast this work in a matter understandable to those
unfamiliar with the research area, but familiar with theoretical Computer
Science in general.

\item Define a range of computational complexity classes in terms of the costs
induced on a particular machine model.\label{explicit}

\item Define a range of computational complexity classes in terms of the
logical principles of a programming language, where all programs are bounded to
the respective complexity.\label{implicit}

\item Prove the definitions in (\ref{implicit}) equivalent to the respective
definitions in (\ref{explicit}).

\item Devise a programming language, where the programmer can state, and be
statically guaranteed, a computational complexity bound on parts of the
program.

\end{enumerate}
