\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Find and survey previous work in an area of research in computational
complexity. 

\item Explain and contrast this work in a matter understandable to those
unfamiliar with the research area, but familiar with computational complexity
in general.

\item Choose and define a range of computational complexity classes, using the
conventional, explicit approach.

\item Categorise the above computational complexity classes in an implicit
matter, and prove them equivalent to their explicit counterparts.

\item Devise a programming language, where the programmer can state, and be
statically guaranteed, a computational complexity bound on parts of the
program.

\end{enumerate}
