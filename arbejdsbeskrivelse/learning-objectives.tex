\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Find and survey previous work in an area of research in Computer Science.

\item Explain and contrast this work in a matter understandable to those
unfamiliar with the research area, but familiar with theoretical Computer
Science in general.

\item Prove that a computational complexity class defined in terms of the
logical principles of a programming language, is equivalent to a computational
complexity class defined in terms of the costs induced on a particular machine
model.

\item Devise a programming language, where the programmer can state, and be
statically guaranteed, a computational complexity bound on parts of the
program.

\end{enumerate}
