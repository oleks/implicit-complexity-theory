\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Survey previous work on implicit complexity theory and contrast it to the
explicit variant. \label{survey}

\item Choose and define a range of computational complexity classes, using the
conventional, explicit approach.

\item Devise a programming language, where the programmer can state, and be
statically guaranteed, a computational complexity bound on a program section.
\label{language}

\item Categorise the above computational complexity classes in an implicit
matter. \label{categorise}

\item Prove the implcit categorisations equivalent to their explicit
counterparts.

\item Extend the language above, providing for effectful bounded sections,
where a programmer is limited to a subset of the language, reducible to an
implicit categorisation of the stated bound. \label{extend}

\end{enumerate}
